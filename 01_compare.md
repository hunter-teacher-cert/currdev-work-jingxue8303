    Compare BJC and code.org
  * Major differences:
    1. BJC's lessons are more project based and multiple concepts could be involved in one lab page. The major goal for this curriculum is to attract students who don't believe themselves as "AP students". 
    2. code.org's lessons provides more scaffolding and support for students to understand. It seems much easier for the teachers to teach with this curriculum.
       
  * Major similiarites:
    1. Both curriculums uses block-based language to deliver the content of CSP which is easier for students who don't have strong programming background to start with.
             
    2. Both curriculums meet the standards and requirements of CSP. They emphsize the important concepts in computer science to incease student's awareness of different issues occured in this field.
       
  * Compare strengths and weaknesses
    Labs from BJC are bit dry and some students don't feel connected to these projects. Code.org seems to have more variety of activities and recources. I believe students will be more motivated to learn about computer science in that way. 
    
  * Would you adopt anything from the curriculum you do not teach into your class if you could? Why?
    For BJC, I would add more interesting unplugged activities to deliver the CS related concepts or just to target student's understanding of the vocabulary. Some lesson in the unit of simulation are a bit confusing and they appears to be difficult for students to grasp the big ideas of computer science concepts.
