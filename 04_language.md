  * Answer the following prompts:
    - What is the course? (grade level, student experience)
        CSP for 10th, 11th, or 12th
        Students needs no experience for programming.
    - What is the language?
        Snap!
    - How does one write & run code in this language?
        Block-based language, very similar to scratch
        Students will write their code by dragging and dropping blocks of pre-made code. Click on the blocks and the code will run.
    - Rate the complexity of the syntax?
        The syntax is pretty simple compare to text-based prgramming language. The major mistake students made is to mixed up local variable with global variable and the program won't run because of that.
    - Strengths
      It is very easy to write codes and the software is visual. Students get immediate feedback about whether or not their programs are working intended. It also comes in a large varieties of languages that ESL students may need.
    - How would you utlilize the strengths in the class?
      My school has very high percentage of ENL students. They would probably shy away from text-based programming lanuages. With Snap!, they might be more engaged and more productive.   
    - Weaknesses
      Too many blocks are pre-made and students might have difficult time to learn text-based programming languages if they get too comfortable with it. 
    - How would you mitigate the weaknesses in the class?
      Emphasize on the structure of coding and encourage students to write down their thoughts before programming. Also, introduce other text-based programming languages by the last two months of the school year. So the students will be more prepared for text-based language
    - Why did you select this language for this class?
      The bar is relatively low and it matches the purpose of CSP. Programming should not be the focus of this course. To promote awarenss and the idea of computer science is the goal for CSP.
