Desribe 2 technological tools you currently use in your classroom. One of which should be a programming tool (if possible). Include:
The name of the tool.
What its general purpose is.
The class(es) you use it in.
How you use it in class.
Why you have selected that tool for that purpose?

Snap!
For coding
CSP
When students do pair programming, they use Snap!
The curriculum BJC requires that and our school is a CS4all school.

Class Dojo
For classroom management, attendance, participation points, and so on
CSP and Geometry 
Record attendance; give participation points; reward positive behaviors
I use it because it makes the participation points visible for students and they are motivated to be engaged in tasks.
