The activity of creating a number guessing game on Snap! asks students to create algorithms for the computer to guess the user's game. 
The learning goals are: 
* Create a script variable to store temporary data.
* Understand that programmers can assign values to variables, more than once to the same variable, unlike students' previous experience with variables in algebra.
* Use iteration to control program flow
* Give feedback to the user

As the students implement an algorithm for a guessing game, they use a local variable to store a randomly generated secret number and a global variable to store the player's score (Addressed concept: Computational Thinking; 9-12.CT.7 Design or remix a program that utilizes a data structure to maintain changes torelated pieces of data. This is under the sub-conpcets of Algorithm and programming. 
Additionally, the students learn how to assign a value to a variable and how to determine the result of sequential variable assignments (Addressed concept:Computational Thinking; 4-6.CT.8 Develop algorithms or programs that use repetition and conditionals for creative expression or to solve a problem.)
