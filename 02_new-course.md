* Come up with an idea for a new comptuer science course that you would teach at your current school.
* Make sure to include the following:
  * General description of the course
    JavaScript by using P5.js
    First, all students are welcome to this class. In this course, we focus on creation of art work, graphic designing, introduction of text-based coding, etc. Students in this class are not taking any AP Exams. The curriculum should be project-based and the students are going to be graded based on their product and their presentations.   
  * Target audiance
    This course is meant for students who are interested in programming but don't want to take any AP courses related to computer science. They may learn simple text-based coding, create their own digital art work, and most importantly they are going to have fun. 
  * Where it fits along with the other courses in your school
    This class can be the very first computer science class they take in High school. Currently, my school offers AP CSP and CSA. CSP serves a greate purpose for introducing computer science to students. However, many students still a bit relectant to enroll in CSP because they are not sure what computer science really is or they believe they are "not good with computers". I think this course can attract more students to increase the enrollment of the CSP course.
    Another reason why I want to add this class to our school is that introducing a simple text-based programming language is going to help them to learn Java in CSA since we use block-based programming language for CSP only. Some students in my school struggle a lot in CSA at the beginning of the course because they don't have any experience about text-based programming language and they are overwhelmed.
